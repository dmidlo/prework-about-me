      <h2>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>To build novel solutions with creativity and constraint.</li>
        <li>I am a lifelong technologist whose passion has been directed at making the innovations of the information age more accessible and enjoyable to average person. Though the body of my work has been in systems and infrastructure administration, my world started to become filled with life as the need for customized, integrated, and well-documented solutions arose. Starting with simple scripts, and moving on to full forms-based provisioning applications, I began to fall in love with new depth of creativity I had achieved. Ultimately I hope to pursue the path of application development leveraging the latest advances in data science, with a view of the pragmatic translation of econometric principles into easy to understand and use applications for use specifically within displaced and disadvantaged communities. This program is within the critical path of my goal of nudging the bar of intergenerational poverty toward a brighter future and the logical next step to achieving that aim.</li>
        <li>Despite my lofty goal of somehow benefiting the larger human condition through the empathetic development of applications; I also hope to teach and pass on 21st century skills to those who would otherwise have no opportunity to pursue. There is a growing divide of privilege in regard to the ever-innovating digital jobs sector; High-speed internet, suitable devices, and qualified & passionate mentors are largely unavailable in the impoverished 'digital deserts' of America. A large swath of Americans are about to be left behind by advances in the age of machine learning, and it is incumbent upon us as technologists to do what we can to provide a substrate of social mobility in the era that's been born from our keyboards.</li>
